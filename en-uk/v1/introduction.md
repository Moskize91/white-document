# Features

#### Support bandwidth high quality playback

Turn on White's record playback function to automatically record the course or conference site. We use a high compression ratio private format .r2wc, one hour of interactive course storage and CDN costs far less than video. And the mobile viewing experience is even better than audio and video.

#### Low latency

White uses a self-developed network transmission engine to deeply customize the transmission strategy under the weak network. The average latency of the interactive experience of the whiteboard is less than 300 ms, allowing users to communicate without remote communication.

#### Low bandwidth

White uses an incremental transmission strategy, and each collaboration only synchronizes the changed information. In normal usage scenarios, network bandwidth is less than 9kbps. You don't have to worry about traffic problems when you use it without wifi.

#### Vector image

White uses a vector rendering solution when customers collaborate remotely using small screen devices such as mobile phones. In the usage scenario with the White zoom function, you don't have to worry about the resolution problem no matter how big it is.

#### Process synchronization

White uses a self-developed synchronization scheme that synchronizes all the subtle drawing processes and operational details on the whiteboard. For example, in the online teaching, draw a curve, the curve will be generated with the teacher's pen, rather than the sudden emergence of the teacher's pen.

#### Easy to use

A comprehensive full-platform SDK, well-designed api and comprehensive documentation make it easy for customers to access the product.

#### High scalability

In the future, we will open the custom tool plug-in system and the synchronization engine platform one after another, which will enable users in all walks of life to enjoy the convenience brought by real-time synchronization more freely.
